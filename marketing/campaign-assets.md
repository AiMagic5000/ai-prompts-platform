### Email 3 - Power User Tips (Day 3)

**Subject:** Most users miss this feature...

**Body:**
Hey [FIRST_NAME],

Quick tip that will 10x your experience:

**The Variable System**

Notice how many prompts have [BRACKETS] in them?

Those are customization variables. Here's how to use them:

Instead of: "You are an expert in [TOPIC]"

You replace it with: "You are an expert in email marketing for SaaS companies"

Every bracketed section is designed to be swapped for your specific needs.

**Pro tips:**
- Be specific when replacing variables
- Keep the surrounding prompt structure intact
- Stack multiple prompts for complex tasks

**Try this workflow:**
1. Use the "Market Research" prompt to understand your audience
2. Feed that output into the "Content Strategy" prompt
3. Use those insights in the "Social Media Post" prompt

The prompts work individually, but they're even more powerful chained together.

More power user tips coming.

### Email 4 - Results Check-in (Day 5)

**Subject:** How are your AI results looking?

**Body:**
Hey [FIRST_NAME],

It's been 5 days since you joined.

Quick question: Have you had an "aha moment" yet?

You know, that moment where AI finally does exactly what you wanted?

If yes - amazing! I'd love to hear about it (just hit reply).

If not - let me help.

**Common early challenges:**

**"I don't know where to start"**
→ Use the search bar. Type what you're trying to accomplish. We've categorized everything by use case.

**"The prompts don't fit my industry"**
→ That's what variables are for! Every [BRACKET] is meant to be customized. See yesterday's email for details.

**"I'm not getting the results I expected"**
→ Make sure you're copying the ENTIRE prompt. Partial prompts = partial results.

**Still stuck?**
Reply to this email with what you're trying to accomplish. I'll personally point you to the right prompts.

# SECTION 5: SOCIAL MEDIA CONTENT

## LinkedIn Posts (10)

### Post 1 - Educational
I've tested 10,000+ AI prompts over the past year.

Here's what separates the ones that work from the ones that don't:

1. Context First
Bad: "Write a marketing email"
Good: "You are a senior B2B marketer at a SaaS company targeting CTOs..."

2. Constraints Create Quality
The more specific your constraints, the better the output.
Word count. Tone. Format. Structure. Give AI guardrails.

3. Examples > Explanations
Show AI what you want, don't just tell it.
Include an example output in your prompt.

4. Chain, Don't Cram
Complex tasks = multiple prompts.
Use output from prompt 1 as input for prompt 2.

5. Iterate the Prompt, Not the Output
If the result isn't right, fix the prompt.
Don't ask AI to "make it better."

These principles are baked into every prompt in our library.

### Post 2 - Hot Take
Unpopular opinion: Most "prompt engineering" content is overcomplicating it.

You don't need to understand AI architecture.
You don't need a certification.
You don't need to spend 40 hours learning.

You need prompts that work.

That's it.

I've compiled 1000+ battle-tested prompts into one library.

Not theory. Not frameworks. Just prompts.

Copy. Paste. Get results.

### Post 3 - Story
6 months ago, I had a client crisis.

They needed 50 product descriptions by Monday. It was Friday at 4pm.

Old me: Panic. Weekend ruined. Barely make deadline.

New me: Opened my prompt library. Found the e-commerce description prompt. Customized for their brand voice.

50 descriptions done by 6pm Friday.

That's when I realized: the prompt IS the work.

Now I've packaged those prompts for everyone.

### Post 4 - Listicle
5 AI prompts that replaced expensive tools:

1. Market Research ($500 reports → free with Claude)
2. Ad Copy Generator (Jasper subscription → gone)
3. SEO Content Brief (SEMrush → still useful, but less critical)
4. Email Sequences (ConvertKit AI → supplemented)
5. Social Media Calendar (Hootsuite AI → replaced)

Not saying AI replaces everything.

But with the right prompts, you need fewer subscriptions.

The prompts that made this possible: prompts.alwaysencrypted.com

### Post 5 - Data/Stats
Data from our prompt library:

- Most copied category: ChatGPT Business prompts
- Rising fastest: Video generation (Sora)
- Most underrated: Data analysis prompts
- Biggest time saver: Content repurposing prompts

Average user saves 5-7 hours per week.

(That's 300+ hours per year.)

What would you do with that time back?

### Thread 2 - Tutorial
How to 10x your Midjourney results 🧵

"A beautiful sunset"

And get generic results.
